# NASAMeteorites
Using data from NASA via JSON, this Python program plots all of the past years meteorite strikes

The information is from data.nasa.gov.  And some of their ID's don't have Long/Lat or Mass so I counted them, but only as errors.  There are currently 40 that are missing data and can't be plotted.  If you use this to teach you might also want to point out that the majority of meteorite data comes from Europe and the US.  There is nothing special that attracts meteorites to those areas, but being heavily populated and (NASA friendly) those are the areas where data is most likely to BE collected.
